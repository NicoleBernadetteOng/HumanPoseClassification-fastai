# Human Pose Classification
A fastai deep learning image classification model that I used in the DSTA BrainHack [Today I Learned 2019](https://dsta.gov.sg/TIL) hackathon. 

The poses dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I7EXZkVUroegcNent506DpAKjcTvr_zD/view?usp=sharing). 
Note: The dataset is not mine so if you use it, please put a note or comment saying that it is from **"The Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Camp â€“ Today I Learned (TIL) 2019"**.
